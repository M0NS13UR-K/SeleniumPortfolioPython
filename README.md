This repository is dedicated to building a complete end-to-end Selenium automation framework using Python. The framework incorporates key concepts such as:
* Selenium WebDriver for browser automation
* Pytest for writing and executing test cases
* Logging for tracking test execution
* Jenkins for continuous integration and a user-friendly GUI

The goal is to create a fully functional automation project as part of a portfolio, hosted in a separate Git repository.
The project starts by leveraging various WebDriver functionalities on a sample website, followed by writing Pytest-based test cases, generating reports, and implementing logging.
Finally, Jenkins is used to manage and visualize test execution efficiently.
